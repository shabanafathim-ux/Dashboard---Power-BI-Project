# Dashboard---Power-BI-Project

üìä HANA Chocolates ‚Äì Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

This project is a portfolio-level Power BI dashboard built to demonstrate how business-critical metrics can be visualized and communicated in a real-world scenario. All data used here is synthetic and for demonstration only, but the dashboard structure, logic, and design reflect how an actual business analytics solution would be delivered.

üìÅ Project Overview

The dashboard presents a complete view of sales performance for HANA Chocolates, focusing on key operational and financial indicators. It‚Äôs designed as an executive-level report ‚Äî the kind a sales or strategy team would use to monitor growth, track performance against targets, and make quick data-driven decisions.

It brings together sales, shipments, costs, and profit metrics into one interactive view, with built-in analysis tools that highlight trends, identify shifts, and surface product-level insights.
