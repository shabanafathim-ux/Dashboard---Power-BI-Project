# Dashboard---Power-BI-Project
üìä HANA Chocolates ‚Äì Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

This project is a portfolio-level Power BI dashboard built to demonstrate how business performance metrics can be visualized and communicated using real-world data. The dataset used here was sourced from Kaggle and is used purely for demonstration purposes ‚Äî it does not represent any actual company‚Äôs confidential information.

üìÅ Project Overview

The dashboard presents a complete view of sales performance for a fictional chocolate brand, HANA Chocolates, highlighting the key metrics that decision-makers track on a monthly basis. It‚Äôs designed as an executive dashboard that combines revenue, cost, shipment, and product-level insights in one place ‚Äî helping users quickly understand business performance and identify growth opportunities.

It‚Äôs built as a realistic example of how I approach data modeling, DAX calculations, visualization design, and storytelling in Power BI.
